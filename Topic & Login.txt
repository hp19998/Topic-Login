Topic :
Adapting Intrusion Detection: A Comparative Study of Suricata and Snort in Dynamic Network Environments | Domain (Advanced computer science masters project) | Major (cyber Security)



Generic Description:
The topic of this research is to analyze how two popular intrusion detection systems, Suricata and Snort, adapt to the challenges posed by growing network environments. With the rapid expansion of networks and the increasing complexity of cyber threats, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of these intrusion detection systems. This study aims to investigate how Suricata and Snort handle the demands of large-scale and dynamic network environments, including high-speed traffic, diverse protocols, and emerging threat patterns. The research will explore the adaptability of these systems in terms of scalability, performance optimization, rule management, and real-time threat detection. The findings will provide valuable insights into enhancing the capabilities of Suricata and Snort for efficient intrusion detection in evolving network landscapes.
